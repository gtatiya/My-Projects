# Mobile Controlled Robot Based on Dual Tone Multi Frequency (DTMF)
- Developed a robot controlled by a mobile phone from anywhere around the world
- Incorporated various hardware such as a Microcontroller (ATMEGA 16), DC Motors, LCD, DTMF decoder
- Included circuit design and hardware programming in C

DTMF Mobile ROBO is a machine that can be controlled with a mobile. In this project, the robot is controlled by a mobile phone that makes a call to the mobile phone attached to the robot. In the course of a call, if any button is pressed, a tone corresponding to the button pressed is heard at the other end of the call. This tone is called "Dual Tone Multiple-Frequency" (DTMF) tone. The robot perceives this DTMF tone with the help of the phone stacked on the robot. The received tone is processed by the microcontroller with the help of DTMF decoder. The microcontroller then transmits the signal to the motor driver ICs to operate the motors and the robot starts moving.
